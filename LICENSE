- See full AGPL-3.0 terms below

**Option B: Commercial License**
- Use in proprietary/closed-source products
- No obligation to share modifications
- Priority support included
- Contact: https://github.com/Theadd/kiro-agents#commercial-license

### For Legacy Versions (Released more than 16 months ago)

**MIT License**
- Free to use, modify, and distribute
- Use in proprietary products without restrictions

## Which License Applies to Me?

### Use AGPL-3.0 (Free) if:
- You're building open source software
- You're okay sharing your modifications
- You want the latest features at no cost
- Your project is also AGPL-compatible

### Purchase Commercial License if:
- You're building proprietary/closed-source software
- You cannot share your modifications
- You need the latest version immediately
- You want priority support

### Use MIT (Free, wait 16 months) if:
- You can wait for the version to mature
- You want maximum freedom with minimal restrictions
- You don't need cutting-edge features
- You prefer battle-tested stable code

## Why This Licensing Strategy?

1. **Protects Against Parasitic Clones** - Prevents rebranding and selling without code sharing
2. **Enables Sustainable Development** - Commercial licenses fund ongoing development
3. **Rewards Patience** - Wait 16 months, get MIT freedom
4. **Encourages Upstream Contribution** - Easier to contribute than maintain separate fork
5. **Eventual Freedom** - All code becomes MIT eventually
6. **Legitimate Forks Welcome** - Technical divergence is encouraged when needed

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I use kiro-agents in my commercial product?

Yes, under three options:
1. Use under AGPL-3.0 (must share your source code)
2. Purchase a Commercial License (no sharing required)
3. Wait 16 months and use under MIT (no restrictions)

### What happens if I violate the AGPL-3.0?

Your license terminates automatically. You must:
- Stop using the software immediately
- Remove all copies from your systems
- May face copyright infringement claims

### Can I fork kiro-agents?

Yes! Forks are encouraged when:
- You need incompatible technical changes
- Original project rejects your proposal after discussion
- You want to take the project in a different direction

Please:
- Keep the AGPL-3.0 license (or wait for MIT)
- Attribute the original project
- Consider contributing upstream when possible

### What if the project becomes unmaintained?

See CONTRIBUTING.md for our succession plan. In summary:
- Active forks can request ownership transfer
- After extended inactivity, project may be relicensed to public domain
- Community can continue development

### Why 16 months instead of 12?

This timeframe:
- Gives recent versions strong protection
- Allows sufficient time for commercial value
- Ensures code is mature and stable before MIT release
- Balances protection with eventual freedom
