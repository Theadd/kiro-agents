# AI-Managed Storage Directory
#
# This directory contains AI-generated reflections, insights, and learnings.
# It is managed by the reflection system and should be committed to version control.
#
# Structure:
#   reflections/
#   ├── drafts/        - Pending insights awaiting curator review
#   └── approved/      - Approved insights organized by tier
#
# Files are created on-demand when agents record their first insight.
# No initialization required - the system creates files as needed.

# Don't ignore anything - commit all reflections
