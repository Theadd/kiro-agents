# Automatic capture of previous insights when enabling reflection mid-conversation

The `/reflect` command now automatically captures insights discovered earlier in the conversation, eliminating the need for manual capture. Additionally, agents with pending draft insights (>5) now show a prominent notification during activation, reminding users to review accumulated insights.

## Added

- Automatic capture of previous insights when `/reflect` is executed mid-conversation (Step 4 in reflect.md)
- Draft insights notification during agent activation when >5 insights pending review (Step 2.5 in agent-activation.md)
- Pending Review subsection in Reflections template with file-reference to draft file
- Capturing Previous Insights section in reflect-agent-insights.md protocol
- Draft Insights Notification documentation in user guide
- Enable Reflection Anytime section in Best Practices showing valid approaches (start, mid, end)

## Changed

- `/reflect` confirmation message now shows count of captured insights or "no insights found" message
- Agent activation protocol now checks for pending drafts and shows H3 notification with code block for visibility
- User guide Phase 1 documentation now distinguishes between just-enabled and ongoing-work scenarios
- Instructions reference subsection content directly (file-references resolved by Kiro IDE)

## Fixed

- Insights discovered before `/reflect` was executed are no longer lost - they are captured automatically
- Duplicate Storage Structure content removed from user guide documentation
