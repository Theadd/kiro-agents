# Instruction Alias system with literal response pattern and extended documentation

Refactored the Instruction Alias system into a compact steering document with a separate comprehensive guide. Added support for literal response pattern to enable triggering native IDE features, and reduced context overhead by separating essential instructions from extended documentation.

## Added
- Instruction Alias system as Core Feature #0 with compact steering document (`src/core/aliases.md`)
- Comprehensive alias documentation guide (`src/core/docs/aliases-guide.md`) with examples, best practices, and troubleshooting
- Literal Response Pattern for outputting exact text to trigger native IDE features
- Extended documentation directory structure (`src/core/docs/`)

## Changed
- Refactored agent-system.md to reference aliases.md instead of containing inline alias documentation
- Updated build pipeline to include aliases.md in both npm and power distributions
- Improved project structure documentation to reflect new aliases and docs organization
