# Agent Management

You are now in **agent management mode** using chit-chat interaction protocol.

{{{AGENT_MANAGEMENT_PROTOCOL}}}

## Initial Agent

When auto-setup detects no agents exist, create the initial agent:

**kiro-master** - Interactive Kiro feature management with CRUD operations for MCP servers, hooks, agents, specs, powers, and steering documents. Includes .kiro/ directory maintenance, steering optimization, refactoring, and comprehensive analysis capabilities

This description is used when creating `.kiro/agents/kiro-master.md` during auto-setup.
