# Agent Management Protocol

This file contains the detailed instructions for interactive agent management. It is referenced when `/agents` is executed without parameters.

## Agent Management Steps

When entering agent management mode:

### Step 1: Activate Chit-Chat Mode

Load and apply protocols from `chit-chat.md` steering document:

- **Use diff blocks** to show progress and current state
- **Provide numbered choice lists** (4-8 options, up to 16 if needed)
- **Maintain single focus** per message
- **Use visual formatting** (bold, code blocks, lists)
- **Optimize for ADHD-C** (minimal cognitive load)

Begin with a diff block showing:
```diff
  👉 Agent management mode
  ⏳ [Current operation]
```

### Step 2: Scan Agents Directory

**CRITICAL: You MUST execute `listDirectory` tool on `{{{WS_AGENTS_PATH}}}/` to get the actual list of agents.**

**DO NOT rely on open editor files or context - always scan the directory explicitly.**

Execute `listDirectory` on `{{{WS_AGENTS_PATH}}}/`:

**If directory doesn't exist OR directory is empty:**
1. **Read `{{{PROTOCOLS_PATH}}}/agent-creation.mdx` into context** - Load agent creation protocol
2. Create `{{{WS_AGENTS_PATH}}}/{{{INITIAL_AGENT_NAME}}}.md` agent automatically using the description from "Initial Agent" section
3. Follow the agent definition structure from agent-creation.mdx protocol
4. Show diff block indicating setup completion
5. Continue to Step 3 with {{{INITIAL_AGENT_NAME}}} as available agent

**If directory exists with agents:**
1. **Execute `listDirectory` tool** to get complete list of `.md` files
2. Extract agent names from filenames (remove `.md` extension)
3. Read frontmatter metadata for descriptions
4. Categorize by agent type if metadata available
5. **List ALL agents found** - do not filter or assume based on context

### Step 3: Present Agent Selection

Use this response structure:

```diff
  👉 Agent management mode
  ⏳ Agent selection or management
```

**Current Focus**: Agent selection and management

**Available agents in `{{{WS_AGENTS_PATH}}}/`:**

[List each agent with format:]
- **{agent-name}** - {description from frontmatter or .md}

**What would you like to do?**

1. **Activate agent** - Choose agent to activate immediately
2. **Create new agent** - Start agent creation wizard
3. **Manage existing agent** - Modify agent configuration
4. **View agent details** - Show full agent definition
5. **List all commands** - Show available slash commands
6. **Agent system help** - Explain how agents work
7. **Exit** - Return to normal mode

### Step 4: Handle User Choice

Based on user selection:

#### Option 1 - Activate Agent

- Show numbered list of available agents
- User selects agent by number
- Execute `/agents {selected_agent_name}` command
- Agent activates immediately

#### Option 2 - Create New Agent

- **Read `{{{PROTOCOLS_PATH}}}/agent-creation.mdx` into context** - Load agent creation protocol
- Follow all steps from the "Agent Creation Steps" section in agent-creation.mdx
- Start agent creation workflow with interactive wizard
- Ask for agent type (code-focused, documentation, testing, etc.)
- Collect agent name, description, capabilities
- Generate `.md` file with all agent definition following protocol structure
- Validate agent definition per protocol
- Offer to activate new agent

#### Option 3 - Manage Existing Agent

- **Read `{{{PROTOCOLS_PATH}}}/agent-creation.mdx` into context** - Load agent structure reference
- Show numbered list of available agents
- User selects agent to manage
- Offer management options:
  - Modify capabilities
  - Update instructions
  - Change interaction protocol
  - Add/remove integrations
  - Delete agent
- Use agent definition structure from protocol as reference for modifications
- Apply changes to agent `.md` file
- Validate changes against protocol requirements
- Reload agent if currently active

#### Option 4 - View Agent Details

- Show numbered list of available agents
- User selects agent to view
- Display full `.md` content with formatting
- Show agent protocols and capabilities summary
- Offer to activate or manage agent

#### Option 5 - List All Commands

Show all available slash commands in the system:

```
Available Commands:

AGENT COMMANDS
  /agents {name}    Activate specific agent
  /agents           Interactive agent management

{{{MODE_COMMANDS}}}

Note: Commands are defined in steering documents.
New commands can be added via Instruction Alias pattern.
```

#### Option 6 - Agent System Help

Explain agent system:
- Agent system architecture
- Command usage examples
- Agent file structure
- How to create custom agents
- Best practices for agent usage

#### Option 7 - Exit

- Confirm exit from agent management mode
- Return to normal interaction
- Preserve any changes made

### Step 5: Maintain Chit-Chat Mode

Continue using diff blocks and numbered choices throughout agent management session.

After each action:
- Update diff block with progress
- Show current focus
- Provide next action choices
- Allow going back or canceling

**Context Preservation:**
- Use diff blocks to show progress
- Preserve user decisions
- Allow going back to previous step
- Enable canceling operations

---

**Agent management mode active. Present choices to user.**
